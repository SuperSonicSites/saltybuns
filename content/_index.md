heading2: Hearty Fresh Flavours and a 1976 Winnebago Named Wild Wanda.
heading2_sub: "West Coast Salty Buns is a BBQ Mexican food truck that came to be through a passion for smoked meat cooked low and slow, hearty and fresh flavours and a 1976 Winnebago named Wild Wanda.<br><br>We smoke all our meats on our 18 foot smoker that is continuously fed with local dry alder for up to 14 hours. Usually this process also involves Chef Brandon, owner and operator enjoying the sounds of the fire popping and the waves crashing with a bourbon or beer in hand.<br><br>We pride ourselves on the quality of ingredients we use, with an emphasis on sourcing wild, local seafood, Vancouver Island produce and BC free range or organic meats.<br><br>The story of West Coast Salty Buns starts with Chef Brandon‚Äôs passion for pairing creative flavours with low and slow cooked meats. Chef Brandon‚Äôs love of smoked meat started young, back on his grandparents farm in Cedar where he learned how to roast and smoke whole hogs with his grandfather.<br><br>Chef Brandon then went on to become Executive Chef at some of BC and Alberta‚Äôs most recognized and prestigious heli-ski and fishing lodges, but the West Coast of Vancouver Island was always calling him home. West Coast Salty Buns is the culmination of Chef Brandon‚Äôs passion and culinary history together to bring his love of great food and ingredients to Ucluelet where he lives with his wife April and their three dogs, Thumper, Theo & Flo.
