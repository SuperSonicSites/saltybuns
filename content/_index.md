Usually this process also involves Chef Brandon, owner and operator enjoying the sounds of the fire popping and the waves crashing with a bourbon or beer in hand.<br><br>We pride ourselves on the quality of ingredients we use, with an emphasis on sourcing wild, local seafood, Vancouver Island produce and BC free range or organic meats.<br><br>The story of West Coast Salty Buns starts with Chef Brandon‚Äôs passion for pairing creative flavours with low and slow cooked meats. Chef Brandon‚Äôs love of smoked meat started young, back on his grandparents farm in Cedar where he learned how to roast and smoke whole hogs with his grandfather.<br><br>Chef Brandon then went on to become Executive Chef at some of BC and Alberta‚Äôs most recognized and prestigious heli-ski and fishing lodges, but the West Coast of Vancouver Island was always calling him home. West Coast Salty Buns is the culmination of Chef Brandon‚Äôs passion and culinary history together to bring his love of great food and ingredients to Ucluelet where he lives with his wife April and their three dogs, Thumper, Theo & Flo.

testimonial4: I had the Side Stripe Bacos (steamed buns) are AMAZING! Light fluffy bun packed full of flavour with fresh ingredients that hit your taste buds and won‚Äôt disappoint! Also had the West Coast Sunday and added the smoked chicken which was tender and flavourful meat that complemented this dish perfectly to round out the meal. Make sure to go hungry as it‚Äôs well worth the trip.

testimonial5: I was impressed with the upbeat and West Coast appeal of the truck, so I had to stop and try the food. It‚Äôs a lovely menu with Mexican influence. I ordered the West Coast Sunday Bites with the smoked chicken and it‚Äôs definitely enough for a meal. It was love at first bite. I also ordered the Side Stripe Bacos, and they did not disappoint. The Chef sources the seafood locally and smokes the fish/meat himself.

testimonial6: Great food, one of the best burritos I have ever had. The Chadzilla is my pick. The bacos and vegan popcorn chicken are also a solid choice. You will not leave hungry I guarantee it. All the fresh ingredients and use of local food is a great touch. They serve locally roasted coffee it‚Äôs wonderful.
